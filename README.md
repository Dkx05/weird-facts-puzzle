# 🧩 Weird Facts Puzzle

Welcome, curious soul...

You've stumbled upon a puzzle that’s not just a game — it's a **gateway** to the unknown. Solve tile puzzles to unlock some of the strangest facts the world (or... beyond) has to offer.

---

## How It Works

- You start with a simple sliding puzzle — just arrange the tiles.
- Every solved puzzle reveals a bizarre, funny, or mind-twisting **fact**.
- After every few puzzles, things... change. 👀
- Not feeling brave? Use the **Skip**, **Auto-Solve**, or **Reveal Answer** buttons to escape (for now).
- New puzzles await: numbers, letters, animals, emojis... each round gets weirder.



## Features

- 🧠 Classic sliding tile puzzle
- 🎭 Multiple puzzle types that evolve as you play
- 🧵 Random weird facts as rewards
- 🔁 “Next Puzzle” button to explore endlessly
- 🧪 Clean, minimal frontend — no frameworks or servers
